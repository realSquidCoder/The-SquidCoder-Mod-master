# The-SquidCoder-Mod
 This is my first Minecraft Forge mod. Feel free to use my code if it helps. (And maybe credit me if you want)

What does this mod do?
- This mod is designed to be a sandbox for me to mess around in to learn how to make mods. ~~Currently, I am backporting 1.17 to 1.16.5 for fun.~~
- Eventually this mod will be split into 3 different mods:~~"SquidCoder's Shinies o' Plenty",~~ "PirateBopa's Boats", "SquidCoder's Steam Mechanics", and "PirateBopa's Swashbuckling Pillagers"
- PirateBopa's Boats and PirateBopa's Swashbuckling Pillagers are jointly mine and PirateBopa's idea.

Credit where credit is due:
- Thx to Kaupenjoe & SilentChaos512 for their AMAZING Forge modding tutorials.
- Thx to everyone who helps with the Create Mod for an amazing mod and great code to look at.
- Thx to Mojang for obvious reasons.
